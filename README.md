# Sentiment-Analysis
Generate Word Embeddingand retrieve outputs of each layer with Keras based on the Classification task.Word embeddingare a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.It is a distributed representation for the text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.We will use the IMDb dataset to learn word embeddingas we train our dataset. This dataset contains 25,000 movie reviews from IMDB, labeled with a sentiment (positive or negative)
